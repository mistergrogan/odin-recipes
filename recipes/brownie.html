    <p>Learn how to makes the ultimate fudgy chocolate brownies... These will not disappoint I promise!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 tablespoons (71 grams) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups (249 grams) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk, cold</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (74 grams) vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (75 grams) cocoa powder*</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (63 grams) all-purpose flour, measured correctly</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (128 grams) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Line an 8 by 8-inch light-colored metal pan** with foil or parchment paper and spray with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
                <br>
            <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, add the butter and sugar. Microwave for about 1 minute, or until the butter is melted. Whisk in the eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla. Stir in the oil and cocoa powder.</li>
                <br>
            <li>With a rubber spatula, stir in the flour, cornstarch, and salt until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Spread the brownie batter evenly into the prepared pan. Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the brownies are set and a cake tester inserted into the center has moist crumbs attached. Do not overcook. Let cool completely to solidify before cutting and serving.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Brownies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. Brownies will be gooey when served warm, chewy when served at room temperature, and fudgy when served chilled.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and slice, finish with a sprinkle of basil and parmigiano-reggiano if you like!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Bon Appetite!</p>
